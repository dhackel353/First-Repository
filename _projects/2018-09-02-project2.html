  In CSC-325, we could either do a final project or take the final. I opted for making a final project.
  Our task was basically just to make something cool in Java with GUI components and multithreading.
  <br><br>
  I decided to simulate cars driving on roads.
  <br><br>
  This project used a graph as learned from CSC-345 which is basically just a series of points.
  The cars drive from point to point and then randomly turn when there is an intersection.
  <br><br>
  It looks pretty neat and is fun to play around with it. It got me a 100 on my final. I'm proud of it.
