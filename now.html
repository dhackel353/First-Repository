<h1>My life plans</h1>

<p>
	Right now I'm currently going to Murray State University. 
	I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. 
	So currently I'm living in an apartment in Murray and working part-time at
	Walmart to pay for it.
	<br>
	Next summer I plan to take an internship to get some on the field experience with programming.
	
	After I get my Bachelor's Degree I will attempt to look for jobs. I will look extensively online for a starter job.
	If I find something that I like, I will do that for a few years. If I'm not satisfied with the pay or with what I'm doing, 
	I will use the previous job experience to find something better. I might even repeat that a few times.
