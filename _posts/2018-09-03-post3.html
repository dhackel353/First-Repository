title: A Typical Day In Walmart CAP2

<p>
  Team CAP2 at Walmart is the team tasked with unloading the trucks and stocking most of the consumables.
</p>
<p>
I work the shift from 12-9pm. Others work a 2-11pm shift. The first shift is tasked with unloading the main truck. 
This truck contains all of the general merchandise and lots of dry food as well.
One person is the thrower. This person gets into the semi-truck trailer and puts boxes onto the line. The line 
is what we use to more easily transport the boxes out of the truck.
A few others are responsible with putting these boxes onto the correct pallet/cart.
It's a very repititive task that can last anywhere from 1-4 hours depending on the truck size that day.

On the other side of the store is where the grocery truck is unloaded. This is the primary task of the 2-11pm shift. 
Everything on this truck is already on pallets, so the pallets are all pulled out and then we have to downstack the pallets.
Downstacks is just taking boxes off of the stack and putting them on the right cart (organizing them by aisle).
<br><br>
When each shift is done with either truck unloading or downstacking, they begin to stock shelves. This is how we spend most of our day.
