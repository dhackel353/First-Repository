  Nvidia has unveiled a new technology for their graphics cards, real-time ray tracing. This technology allows for 
  much better shadows in video games and is quite amazing. The feature is only available in the upcoming line of Nvidia RTX graphics cards.
  But is it worth it?
  <br><br>
  Reasons to get one
  <ul>
    <li>Amazing shadows</li>
  </ul>
  
  Reasons to not get one
  <ul>
    <li>They are crazy expensive (around $1000)</li>
    <li>They aren't even confirmed to be more powerful than current gpus</li>
    <li>Most games won't support the technology for some time</li>
  </ul>
  
  Am I getting one? No. I recommend not getting one unless you're an enthusiast with crazy amounts money.
