<p>
  For the unacquainted, Nintendo is releasing Smash Bros. Ultimate this December.
  Fans are generally very satisfied about all the new characters announced and that all old characters are returning.
</p>


  But there is one character that deserves to be in the game above all others. Waluigi. 
  <br><br>
  Waluigi has been long overdue to being a playable character. Nintendo mocks him by only making him an assist trophy. 
<br><br>
He should by in Smash because he is a cool character. He would have an amazing moveset and be beyond a doubt the most played character.
His special moves would involve his tennis racquet and bombs.
